# Kaggle-Competition-Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-a-Disaster

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this project we are going to accurately predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. We have to rename the 'Survived' column in the test dataset a 0 or 1 value. For this we are going to explore machine learning workflow to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
